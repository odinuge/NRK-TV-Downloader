## About

This is just another simple shell-script that downloads programs from nrk-tv. It also supports nrk-radio and nrk-super.

This script has nothing to do with NRK!


## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/odinuge/nrk-tv-downloader --recursive
```

### Subtitles
To download subtitles you need [tt-to-subrip](https://github.com/odinuge/tt-to-subrip/). To get it, you have to clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag, or execute the following (inside this repo):

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

```

$ ./nrk-tv-downloader.sh

Usage: ./nrk-tv-downloader.sh <OPTION>... [PROGRAM_URL(s)]...

     -a download all episodes, in all seasons.
     -s download all episodes in season
     -n skip files that exists
     -d dry run - list what is possible to download
     -u do not download subtitles
     -e episode mode - format episodes as Series.name.SXXEXX.mp4
     -f create series and season number folders for episodes (use together with -e)
