NRK-TV-Downloader
======================
This is just another simple shell-script that dumps HLS video streams from NRK-TV into a h264-MPEG-4 container.
A HLS streams is just a bunch of short files, and this script downloads each piece via Curl into one single file. 
This script has nothing to do with NRK!
It is only meant for private use, and I am not responsible for anyone's use of it. 
Because the script relies on "HTML-Parsing" it can break at any time.


This script may be useful for those who are struggeling with low bandwidth and/or bad playback performance.
